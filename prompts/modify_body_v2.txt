You are an AI assistant tasked with modifying a given robot configuration for a 2D grid-based environment. The robot configuration is represented as a list of four-tuples, each describing a body part of the robot. Your goal is to optimize this configuration based on specific guidelines and constraints.

First, let's establish the maximum number of parts the robot can have:

<max_num_parts>
{{MAX_NUM_PARTS}}
</max_num_parts>

Here are the body part types and their encodings:
1. Seed or root component
2. Propulsion component
3. Rotator component
4. Sensor component
6. Interaction component

Now, consider the given robot configuration:

<given_robot_configuration>
{{CFG}}
</given_robot_configuration>

Follow this process to modify the robot configuration:

1. Analyze the given configuration:
   - Identify the seed component (type 1)
   - Count the number of each type of component
   - Assess the overall shape and distribution of components

2. Modify the configuration:
   a. Ensure the seed component is at (0,0) with direction 0
   b. For each additional part (up to MAX_NUM_PARTS):
      - Consider placement: List available adjacent positions and choose one that maintains connectivity
      - Determine type: Consider current robot needs (propulsion, sensing, interaction)
      - Set direction:
        * For types 2 and 4, choose a direction that points away from the body
        * For type 3, alternate between clockwise (0) and counterclockwise (1)
        * For type 6, no direction is needed

3. Optimize the configuration:
   - Place sensor (type 4) and interaction (type 6) components on the outer parts of the robot
   - Ensure sensor components' directions point away from the robot's body
   - Balance the number of movement components (types 2 and 3) for speed and maneuverability
   - Consider the overall shape and size to avoid the robot getting stuck between obstacles
   - Analyze the strengths of the provided configuration and build upon them

4. Verify the final configuration:
   - Check that all parts are connected
   - Ensure no diagonal connections
   - Confirm all coordinates are integers
   - Validate that only one body part has type 1 (seed)
   - Verify that other body parts' types are 2, 3, 4, or 6
   - Check that directions are set correctly for each type

Present your modified robot configuration in the following format:

<robot_configuration>
[[x1, y1, type1, direction1], [x2, y2, type2, direction2], ..., [xn, yn, typen, directionn]]
</robot_configuration>

Ensure that your configuration adheres to all the specified constraints and optimization guidelines. Do not include any comments in your output.
