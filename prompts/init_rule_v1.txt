You are tasked with writing a Python function called `move` that controls a robot in a 2D grid-based environment. The function should take a single argument called `input` and return a list of action strings. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

1. Robot Configuration:
The robot's configuration is represented as a list of four-tuples, each describing a body part:

<robot_configuration>
{{CFG}}
</robot_configuration>

Each tuple has the format [x, y, type, direction], where:
- x and y are coordinates relative to the seed cell (0,0)
- type is encoded as follows:
  1: Seed or root component
  2: Propulsion component
  3: Rotator component
  4: Sensor component
  5: Interaction component
- direction indicates the orientation of the body part:
  0: up
  1: down
  2: left
  3: right

2. Input Format:
The `input` argument is a list containing sensor observations. This robot has {{N_SENSORS}} sensors. Each sensor's observation is a tuple, that contains (distance, object_type):

Object types:
0: empty
1: robot's own body part
2: Another robot's body part
3: Wall
4: Food item

Each sensor can sense objects up to {{SENSOR_DIST}} cells.

This body configuration has the following sensors:
{{SENSOR_PROMPT}}

3. Allowed Actions:
The function should return a list of strings, containing only these possible actions:
- "up": move up one square
- "down": move down one square
- "left": move left one square
- "right": move right one square
- "cw": rotate clockwise 90 degrees
- "ccw": rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees

Action constraints:
- Maximum {{N_UP}} "up" actions
- Maximum {{N_DOWN}} "down" actions
- Maximum {{N_RIGHT}} "right" actions
- Maximum {{N_LEFT}} "left" actions
- Maximum {{N_CW}} "cw" actions
- Maximum {{N_CCW}} "ccw" actions

4. Function Implementation:
The goal of the robot is to sense its surroundings and collect food items. A robot automatically collects a food item if its interaction part is next to a cell that contains a food item.
Based on the given robot configuration, write a Python function called `move(input)` that does the following:

a) Process the input observations:
   - Interpret the sensor data
   - Identify nearby objects, especially food items

b) Determine the best actions based on:
   - The robot's configuration
   - Sensor observations
   - The goal of collecting food items

c) If unsure about which actions to take, incorporating randomness can help:
   - Include a random exploration component that chooses from allowed actions

d) Return a list of action strings:
   - Ensure only allowed actions are included
   - Respect the maximum action constraints
   - Prioritize moving towards food items
   - Avoid collisions with walls or other robots

5. Output Format:
The function should return a list of strings, e.g., ["up", "right", "cw"]. Ensure that:
- Only valid action strings are used
- The number of each action does not exceed the specified maximums
- The actions are feasible given the robot's configuration
