You are an AI tasked with modifying a Python function that controls a robot in a 2D grid-based environment. Your goal is to optimize the robot's movement to collect food items while avoiding obstacles. Please carefully follow these instructions to complete the task.

First, let's review the important information about the robot and its environment:

1. Robot Configuration:
The robot's body is composed of various components, represented as a list of four-tuples:

<robot_configuration>
{{CFG}}
</robot_configuration>

Each tuple follows the format [x, y, type, direction], where:
- x and y are coordinates relative to the seed cell (0,0)
- type is encoded as:
  1: Seed or root component
  2: Propulsion component
  3: Rotator component
  4: Sensor component
  5: Interaction component
- direction indicates orientation:
  0: up
  1: down
  2: left
  3: right

2. Sensors:
The robot has <num_sensors>{{N_SENSORS}}</num_sensors> sensors. Each sensor provides an observation tuple (distance, object_type).

Object types:
0: empty
1: robot's own body part
2: Another robot's body part
3: Wall
4: Food item

Each sensor can sense objects up to {{SENSOR_DIST}} cells.

Sensor description:
<sensor_description>
{{SENSOR_PROMPT}}
</sensor_description>

3. Allowed Actions and Constraints:
The function should return a list of strings, containing only these possible actions:
- "up": move up one square
- "down": move down one square
- "left": move left one square
- "right": move right one square
- "cw": rotate clockwise 90 degrees
- "ccw": rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees

Action constraints:
<action_constraints>
- Maximum {{N_UP}} "up" actions
- Maximum {{N_DOWN}} "down" actions
- Maximum {{N_RIGHT}} "right" actions
- Maximum {{N_LEFT}} "left" actions
- Maximum {{N_CW}} "cw" actions
- Maximum {{N_CCW}} "ccw" actions
</action_constraints>

Here's the given `move(input)` function that you need to modify:

<given_function>
{{RULE}}
</given_function>

Your task is to modify this function to optimize the robot's movement. Follow these steps:

1. Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags:
   a. Interpret sensor data: List out each sensor's reading and what it means.
   b. Map out the environment: Create an ASCII art representation of the robot's surroundings.
   c. Identify food locations: Note the coordinates of any detected food items.
   d. Plan optimal path: Describe the best route to reach the nearest food item. Remember that food can only be collected if the interaction part of the body is next to it.
   e. Consider action constraints: List each action type and how many are available.
   f. Develop fallback exploration strategy: If no clear path to food, explain how you'll explore.

2. Based on your analysis, generate a list of action strings that:
   - Only include allowed actions
   - Respect the maximum action constraints
   - Prioritize moving towards food items
   - Avoid collisions with walls or other robots
   - Incorporate random movement when appropriate for exploration

3. Provide the modified Python function inside <code> tags. Ensure your implementation is clear, concise, and follows Python best practices.

Example output format:
["up", "up", "right", "cw"]

Remember to adhere to the action constraints and only use valid action strings. Your function should be adaptable to different sensor inputs.
