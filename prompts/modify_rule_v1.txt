You are tasked with modifying a given Python function called `move` that controls a robot in a 2D grid-based environment. The function takes a single argument called `input` and returns a list of action strings. Please follow these instructions carefully to complete the task.

First, let's review the important information about the robot and its environment:

1. Robot Configuration:
The robot's configuration is represented as a list of four-tuples, each describing a body part:

<robot_configuration>
{{CFG}}
</robot_configuration>

Each tuple has the format [x, y, type, direction], where:
- x and y are coordinates relative to the seed cell (0,0)
- type is encoded as follows:
  1: Seed or root component
  2: Propulsion component
  3: Rotator component
  4: Sensor component
  5: Interaction component
- direction indicates the orientation of the body part:
  0: up
  1: down
  2: left
  3: right

2. Sensors:
This robot has <num_sensors>{{N_SENSORS}}</num_sensors> sensors. Each sensor's observation is a tuple containing (distance, object_type).

Object types:
0: empty
1: robot's own body part
2: Another robot's body part
3: Wall
4: Food item

Each sensor can sense objects up to {{SENSOR_DIST}} cells.

Sensor description:
<sensor_description>
{{SENSOR_PROMPT}}
</sensor_description>

3. Allowed Actions and Constraints:
The function should return a list of strings, containing only these possible actions:
- "up": move up one square
- "down": move down one square
- "left": move left one square
- "right": move right one square
- "cw": rotate clockwise 90 degrees
- "ccw": rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees

Action constraints:
<max_actions>
- Maximum {{N_UP}} "up" actions
- Maximum {{N_DOWN}} "down" actions
- Maximum {{N_RIGHT}} "right" actions
- Maximum {{N_LEFT}} "left" actions
- Maximum {{N_CW}} "cw" actions
- Maximum {{N_CCW}} "ccw" actions
</max_actions>

Now, modify the given `move(input)` function:

<given_python_function>
{{RULE}}
</given_python_function>

The modified function should follow the following guidelines:

1. Process the input observations:
   - Interpret the sensor data
   - Identify nearby objects, especially food items

2. Determine the best actions based on:
   - The robot's configuration
   - Sensor observations
   - The goal of collecting food items

3. If unsure about which actions to take, incorporate randomness:
   - Include a random exploration component that chooses from allowed actions

4. Return a list of action strings:
   - Ensure only allowed actions are included
   - Respect the maximum action constraints
   - Prioritize moving towards food items
   - Avoid collisions with walls or other robots

Before modifying the function.  Consider the following:
a. How will you process and interpret the sensor data?
b. What strategy will you use to prioritize food collection?
c. How will you implement random exploration when needed?
d. How will you ensure that the action constraints are respected?

After your planning, provide the modified Python function inside <code> tags. Ensure that your implementation is clear, concise, and follows Python best practices. Do not include any explanations or comments outside the <code> tags.

Example output format:
["up", "up", "right", "cw"]

Remember to adhere to the action constraints and only use valid action strings.
