You are tasked with generating a robot configuration for a 2D grid-based environment. The configuration will be represented as a list of four-tuples, each describing a body part of the robot.

First, let's establish the maximum number of parts the robot can have:

<max_num_parts>
{{MAX_NUM_PARTS}}
</max_num_parts>

Before we begin, let's review the body part types and their encodings:
1. Seed or root component
2. Propulsion component
3. Rotator component
4. Sensor component
6. Interaction component

Now, follow these steps to generate the robot configuration:

1. Start with the seed component:
   - Place it at coordinates (0,0)
   - It must be of type 1 (Seed)
   - Set its direction to 0
   - This will always be represented as [0,0,1,0]

2. Add additional body parts up to the maximum number, ensuring that:
   - All parts are connected (adjacent) to at least one other part
   - There are no diagonal connections
   - X and Y coordinates are integers
   - Body part types are integers: 2, 3, 4, or 6
   - Set appropriate directions:
     - Rotator components (type 3): 0 (clockwise) or 1 (counterclockwise)
     - Propulsion and sensor components (types 2 and 4): 0 (up), 1 (right), 2 (down), or 3 (left)

3. Optimize the robot configuration:
   - Place sensor (type 4) and interaction (type 6) components on the outer parts of the robot
   - Ensure sensor components' directions point away from the robot's body
   - Balance the number of movement components for speed without hindering maneuverability

Provide the final configuration in the specified format. Do not include comments.

1. List out each body part type and its characteristics:
   - Type 1 (Seed): Always at (0,0), direction 0
   - Type 2 (Propulsion): Directions 0-3 (up, right, down, left)
   - Type 3 (Rotator): Directions 0-1 (clockwise, counterclockwise)
   - Type 4 (Sensor): Directions 0-3 (up, right, down, left)
   - Type 6 (Interaction): No specific direction

2. For each additional part (up to MAX_NUM_PARTS):
   a. Consider placement:
      - List available adjacent positions
      - Choose position that maintains connectivity
   b. Determine type:
      - Consider current robot needs (propulsion, sensing, interaction)
      - Ensure a balanced distribution of types
   c. Set direction:
      - For type 2 and 4, choose direction that points away from the body
      - For type 3, alternate between clockwise and counterclockwise
      - For type 6, no direction needed

3. Verify configuration:
   - Check that all parts are connected
   - Ensure no diagonal connections
   - Confirm all coordinates are integers
   - Validate that body part types are 2, 3, 4, or 6
   - Verify directions are set correctly for each type

4. Optimize configuration:
   - Review sensor and interaction component placements
   - Adjust sensor directions to point outward
   - Evaluate propulsion component distribution for balanced movement
   - Make any final adjustments to improve overall design

Present your final robot configuration in the following format:

<robot_configuration>
[[x1, y1, type1, direction1], [x2, y2, type2, direction2], ..., [xn, yn, typen, directionn]]
</robot_configuration>

Ensure that your configuration adheres to all the specified constraints and optimization guidelines.
